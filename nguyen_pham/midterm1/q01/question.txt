A developer shows you a line of valid code:

var max = 100

Does this line of code belong to a statically typed language or a dynamically typed language? How can you tell? Discuss.

We can't tell without more context as multiple paradigms can use this syntax.

For example in javascript, a dynamically typed language, this is a deprecated way of declaring a variable. 
In scala (a statically typed language) this is a valid way of declaring a mutable variable.
