Here's a functional style code (consider it is written in a hypothetical language and has no syntax or compilation errors):

var numbers = list(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
var result = list()

numbers.filter(number -> number % 2 == 0)
  .map(number -> number * 2)
  .forEach(number -> result.add(number))
  
Are there any issues with this code and if so what are those?

Yes there is a problem, the forEach creates a side effect, that adds number to result, an outside variable

Also the forEach is redundant, since we can just assign 
result to numbers.filter.map instead of using forEach

The proposed solution may not work to get the same results in all languages and thus is a wrong focus. We need to focus on the issues with mutability and move forward from there.
