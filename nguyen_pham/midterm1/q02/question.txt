All dynamically typed languages are not weakly typed but all weakly typed languages are dynamically typed.

Discuss in favor or against the above statement. Provide enough details and examples to support your arguments.


This statement is false, C is example of a static language that is weakly typed. 
In C you can do things like this:

    int a = 1;
    void* p = &a;
    int *q = p;

This is perfectly valid C code, and it will compile and run. The compiler will not complain about the type mismatch.

This disproves the statement that all weakly typed languages are dynamically typed.
