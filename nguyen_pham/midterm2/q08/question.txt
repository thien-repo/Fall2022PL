What's a tuple and what's special about them? 

Where would we use them?

Give a few examples of usage of tuples from two languages that we covered in 
this course (give code in separate files with proper extensions).



We would use them when we want to make sure that the data in a list doesn't change.

In our assign1 python we used tuples to store data of the test cases.
We didn't want the data to be changed by the test cases so we used tuples to store the data making it immutable. 
Testing the code was also easier because we could just compare the tuples to see if the code was working correctly,
and we didn't have to worry about the data being changed by the test cases.



In our assign4 c# we used tuples to store the data of two different types 
the first being the Result and the second being the attempt.
These two values should not be changed once they are set so we used tuples to store them in a single variable.

Its a great use for when we have a set of data that we don't want to change, such as when we run things in parallel.
We can use tuples to store the data and then pass it to the threads so that the data is not changed by the threads.
