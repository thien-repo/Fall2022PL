What is a REPL? Discuss some benefits of REPL. Show a samle session (copy and paste) of using the REPL for a language of your choice.

Read-Evaluate-Print Loop (REPL) started with Lisp Interpretive Environment, but several languages now support it. 

Some benefit of REPL is that it's easy to evaluate expressions, helps to learn a language and it helps to experiment and build code.
