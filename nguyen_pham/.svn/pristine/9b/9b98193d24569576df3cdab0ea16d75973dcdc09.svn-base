Assign2: Due 11:59PM CT October 7

***Please review the top part of ../hw1/hw1.txt***
***Your chance of success greatly increases if you start very early. Your chance of failure increases if you start late. Please use as many reviews as you possibly can.***

Pick three languages for this assignment. At least one of the languages you pick has to be statically typed and at least one has to be dynamically typed. At least one of the languages you pick should not be the one you have already used in assignment 1. All the languages you pick have to support tail call optimization natively, that is not through extensions. Please drop an email to Venkat to check if your language choices are OK before you invest too much time into any of them.

Start with a build file and unit tests. 

Now to the problem at hand.

Fibonacci series is the number sequence

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...

Given a number n, the series is defined as

F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) where

F(0) is 1 and F(1) is 1.

Assume that n is >= 0. No need to check for values of n less than 0.

Given a number n, write functions to return the Fibonacci series until that position n, using:

1. an iterative procedure and process

2. a recursive procedure and process

3. a recursive procedure with an iterative process

Please work on one language at a time and make extensive use of reviews.

Start early and finish early without stress.

Ask for help if you are stuck. Remember to time box your efforts.
