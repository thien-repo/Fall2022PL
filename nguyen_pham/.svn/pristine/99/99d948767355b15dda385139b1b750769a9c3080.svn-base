We're going to design and implement a DSLâ€”Domain Specific Language in this assignment. The syntax for the DSL will be influenced by the languages we use. For that reason, do not take the example below literally.

Design a DSL in two different languages, one statically typed and the other dynamically typed. The language you choose should have low ceremony (for example, but not limited to, does not require ;)

The DSL will be used to make a Pizza object. The syntax has to be highly fluent (not feel like code), has less noise, read more like English. The syntax will vary depending on the capability of the languages used, but here's one example:

create Pizza
  spread sauce
  spread cheese
  toppings onions, jalapenos, green_pepper
  spread cheese
  bake

Running this code should print the details of the pizza that was created: what's in each layer (sauce, cheese, toppings names, and cheese).

You could have variations to the pizza being made, for example, add other toppings. Try out a couple of different examples in your tests.

Create build files and write code in increments after writing test first. Ask for frequent reviews, start with one language first, get that done before moving to the next language.
